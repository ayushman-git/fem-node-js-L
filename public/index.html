        The '+' operater can be defined as overlaoded because it can perform two
        different operations based on the operands.
        <ul>
          <li>Mathematical addition - 4 + 2</li>
          <li>String concatenation - "Hello" + " World"</li>
        </ul>
        <li>'==' is also called loose equality operator.</li>
        <li>NULL is an empty value but it is an object.</li>
      </li>
      <li>Array is basically a subset of object. That's why <code>typeof [2,3]</code> will return object.</li>
      <li>The block of code which checks the logic condition is known as <stron>Test Clause</stron></li>
      <li><b>arr.pop()</b> deletes an array from last element. <b>arr.shift()</b> deletes an array from first element.</li>
      <li><strong>Primitive data types: </strong> - undefined, string, number, symbol, object, boolean</li>
      <li>null is defined as an object, and so do function and arrays. They are subset of object.</li>
      <li>In JS we can define one type of var with another type of value because JS is not strongly typed.<br>
      So let v = 2; v = "string"; v = {a: "A"}
      </li>
    </ul>

        Expressions are little fragments of statments, on their own they have single meaning.

        Statements are combinations of expressions and they serve as one unit of sentence.
