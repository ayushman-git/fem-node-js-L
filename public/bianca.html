    <h1>From Fundamental to Functional</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>'.' operater is always used with objects.</li>
      <li>
        <table border>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Reference
            </th>
            <th>
              Value
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Non-primitive (objects) values are stored as reference.</td>
            <td>Primite values are stored as values.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Values stored in objects are actually pointers that reference to
              the value. Obj -> name -> "Ayushman"
            </td>
            <td>
              Primitive values directly have the value in that variable.
              sameName -> "Ayushman"
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>
        '.' notation coerce the variable intro string except when its starting
        with digits or dash.
      </li>
      <li>
        The main difference between array and object is that array has order
        because of sequeantial indices. So we can use multiple built in
        properties and functions.
      </li>

      <li>
        With the help of <strong>destructuring</strong>, we can assign values to
        new variables from a source (obj, array etc) in a single line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>forEach</strong> iterates through each element but don't return
        anything. On the other hand <strong>map</strong> iterates as well as
        return a new array.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arrow Function</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b
          >The main difference between arrow and normal function is of 'this'
          meaning</b
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        In a normal function every function have their own this reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        But arrow functions don't have their own this reference. So they can be
        used to refer to the parent function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projection means taking data from one data structure and converting it
        into another one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce()</strong> - It takes and array and return a single
        output. <br />
        <code
          >arr.reduce(callback( accumulator, currentValue[, index[, array]] )[,
          initialValue])</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Currying</strong>
        - it means we can give arguments to a function at different time and
        once function has all the arguments it will be executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Composing</strong> - it means combining several functions into
        one function.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Closure</strong> - A closure is the combination of a function
        bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state
        (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to
        an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript,
        closures are created every time a function is created, at function
        creation time.
      </li>
      <h4>Normal Function</h4>
      <pre><code>
        function Person() {
          var that = this;
          that.age = 0;
        
          setInterval(function growUp() {
            // The callback refers to the `that` variable of which
            // the value is the expected object.
            that.age++;
          }, 1000);
        }
        </code></pre>
      <h4>Arrow Function</h4>
      <pre><code>
        function Person(){
          this.age = 0;
        
          setInterval(() => {
            this.age++; // |this| properly refers to the Person object
          }, 1000);
        }
        
        var p = new Person();
      </code></pre>
